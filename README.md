# Laravel Coding Test for Gamepoint (Dockerized with Sail)

This is a fully self-contained Laravel application using [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/sail) — a Docker-based development environment. No local PHP, Composer, or MySQL setup is required. Just Docker.

---

##  Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- macOS, Linux, or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

---

##  Quick Start (No Composer Required)
You can use Laravel Valet, Laravel Herd or Laravel Sail/Docker.

You can start the app even if `composer` and `vendor/` are not installed locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:klau88/gamepoint.git
cd gamepoint

2. ** Install dependencies and start Sail:**

docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php82-composer:latest \
    composer install

# Start Sail (first time setup)
vendor/bin/sail up -d

3. **Run migrations and seeders:**

vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed

4. **Open your browser:**
http://localhost

** Common Sail Commands**
vendor/bin/sail up -d           # Start containers
vendor/bin/sail down            # Stop containers
vendor/bin/sail shell           # Enter container shell
vendor/bin/sail artisan         # Run artisan commands
vendor/bin/sail npm install     # Frontend setup (if applicable)

**♻ Reset Database**
vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
